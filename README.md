# hrir
HRIR processing of audio using CIPIC database

## Colab Notebook
HRIR filters downloaded from https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/cipic/spatial-sound/hrtf-data/
These were imported into MATLAB R2015b and re-exported as .dat to allow importing into python 3.7 with scipy.io.loadmat

Audio sample from Old School Tie. All rights reserved.

## TI DSP code
The HRIRs from CIPIC can be exported as header files and run on a TI c55x DSP. Older code from 2015 is added here for archiving.
